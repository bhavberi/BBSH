# **BB-SHELL [_BBSH_ ]** (_V2.0_ )

_Made for an assignment/s for OS&N Course Monsoon 2022-23._

_Completely coded in `C`._

## Build & Run
1. `make` / `make bbsh` (For building the executable file)
2. `make clean` (For cleaning the built files)

## ABOUT
_BB-SHELL_ is a very ~~advanced~~ noob shell, which can do some work, but very limited. :sweat_smile:

It has some of the following features as of now:- (More may ~~not~~ come later)

- Colourful shell display with username/hostname and current directory.
- Can run some built-in commands such as `cd`, `echo`, `pwd`, `ls` (With -a and -l flags).
- Other Commands - `pinfo` (≈ ps), `discover` (≈ find with -d and -f flags)
- Stores `history` of upto 20, for all the sessions.
- Error Handling
- Can run both `background` qand `foreground` processes. (For any other shell commands)
- Multiple Command Execution in a single line using `;`.
- `exit` is used to exit the shell.
- I/O Redirection using pipes and < & >/>>.
- Autocomplete file names.
- Signal Handling (Ctrl-C, Ctrl-Z, Ctrl-D)
